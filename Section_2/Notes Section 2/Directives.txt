Directives

directives are instructions in the DOM

ngIf: is a condicional if statement
    Example: *ngIf="variableNameOfBoolean || functionThatReturnsBoolean"


If & Else: is a condicional statement
    Example:
        <p *ngIf="serverCreated; else noServer">Server was created, server name is {{ serverName }}</p>
        <ng-template #noServer>
            <p>No server has been created</p>
        </ng-template>

To override class use ngClass only works if the condition is true 
otherwise it will not works
    Example:
        1) in html, in a tag(div,p), the following code: 
            [ngClass]="{online: serverStatus === 'online'}"
           in the .ts, we add the style in the component area:
            styles: [`
                .online{
                    color: white;
                }
            `]

ngFor directive, is the for statement.
for the statement to work we declare our ngFor in our tag and 
we declare write let, declare a variable by us and call our variable list.
    Example:
        1) *ngFor="let varNameGivenByYou of varNameInTS"
