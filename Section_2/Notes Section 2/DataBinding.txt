Types of DataBinding

String Interpolation: 
    example 
        1 - {{ variableName || 'String' }}
        2 - {{ 'String' }}
        3 - {{ functionThatReturnsString }}


Property DataBinding is the binding of function with attributes
you must wrap in '[]' for valid property binding.
    Example:
        1) - in html: <p [innerText] = "allowNewServer"
           - in .ts: setTimeout(()=>{
                        this.allowNewServer = true;
                    },2000);
                    
Event Binding is binding funciton similiar to a button triggerring a button
    Example:
        1) in html: add to button => (click)="onCreateServer()"
        2) in .ts: onCreateServer(){
                        this.serverCreationStatus = 'server was created';
                    }

Two way binding the combination of property and event binding
    Example:
        1) to declare in html use the following sintax: 
            [(ngModel)] = "variableName"
