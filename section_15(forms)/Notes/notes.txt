Forms
use forms for:
    - check for valid informacion.
    - 

Two aproaches:
    - Template-Driven: Angular infers the Form Object from the DOM.
        - literally a Template
        
    - Reactive: Form is created programatically and synchornized with the DOM.
        - you can personalize


Check Form to se value of Objects.
