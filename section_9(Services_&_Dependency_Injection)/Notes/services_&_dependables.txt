What are services: Is another class that acts as a central repository.
Example of services:

Angular Dependency Injector:  This injects an instance of the class automatically
all we must is inform angular we require that instance.
    - This is a Hierarchical Injector
        - If we provide it in the AppModule, we can access from our whole app.
        - The app components all instances are avaible for all components
        - These always propagate down
        - Can be avaible for only one component.
